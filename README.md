# Rapid protein structure similarity search
</br>
For rapid protein structure similarity search, all proteins in the PDB encoded to 1D structural alphabet based on Phi, Psi angles or C-alpha angles.</br></br>
The encodes 1D structural alphabet used as query input and compared to the 1D structural alphabet in the database of Phi and Psi or C-alpha structural datadabse.</br></br>
This code was written in Perl and it has a number of applications:
<li>Short protein segments similarity search</li>
<li>Protein domain similarity search</li>
<li>Multiple segments similarity search (on the same protein chain)</li>
<li>Multiple segments similarity search (on different protein chains)</li>
